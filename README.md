# 🔐 BioKey: DNA-Parametrized Chaotic Encryption

This Streamlit app implements a secure encryption scheme using DNA sequence randomness and chaotic system switching (Lorenz, Rössler, Chen) to enhance cryptographic strength.

## 🚀 Features
- Encrypt text or images using DNA-driven chaotic systems
- Use predefined DNA sequences or enter your own
- Analyze GC content and system usage
- Export key traces and encrypted output
- Decrypt previously encrypted content

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Run

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
