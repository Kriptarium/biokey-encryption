# 🔐 BioKey: DNA-Parametrized Chaotic Encryption

BioKey is a hybrid encryption model that combines DNA sequence randomness and dynamic chaotic system switching (Lorenz, Rössler, Chen) to enhance cryptographic security.

## 🚀 Features
- NCBI integration: Fetch public DNA sequences directly by gene name
- Segment-based system switching using GC content
- XOR-based encryption using chaotic maps
- SHA-256 hash for integrity
- Entropy and NPCR analysis for security evaluation
- Exportable key trace log
- Full Streamlit web interface

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
