# 🔐 BioKey: DNA-Parametrized Chaotic Encryption

This Streamlit app implements a secure encryption scheme that combines DNA sequence randomness and chaotic system switching (Lorenz, Rössler, Chen).

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 Fetch DNA sequences directly from NCBI using gene names
- 🔐 Encrypt text based on DNA-guided chaotic systems
- 🧬 Dynamic system selection based on GC content
- 📊 GC content and system usage visualization
- 📈 NPCR & Entropy analysis
- 🧾 Exportable key trace and SHA-256 checksum

## ▶️ Run Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
